Anisotropic images are quite common, and are often difficult to manipulate. The filter proposed here make it simple to transform an anisotropic image in an isotropic one.

\section{Introduction}

Even if the 3D imaging is more and more common, lots of images still have anisotropic resolution. With confocal microscopy for example, the resolution is still lower on the axe z than on the axes x and y.

The filter proposed here let the user easily produce a isotropic image from an anisotropic one, while some options let him choose which method to use, and limit the size of the output image.

\section{Implementation}

IsotropicResolutionImageFilter is built as a sequence of filters. Everything done is fully feasible without those filter - IsotropicResolutionImageFilter is just there to make easily set up the resample, and to make integration in a pipeline easier.

The by default, the filter will use linear interpolation to compute the new pixels, and will smooth the image with a gaussian filter if the number of pixel is decrease on an axe to avoid aliasing effects. This is well described in the ITK Software Guide, chapter 6.9\cite{ITKSoftwareGuide}~\footnote{However, contrary to what is said in the ITK Software Guide, you shouldn't feel so guilty to resample your anisotropic images. Yes, sometime, it's just the best thing to do.}.

The user can also choose to use only the nearest neighbors. This method should be used with synthetics images, to avoid introducing new labels for example.
